# Minecraft_PokeWorld
Repository to store a Minecraft map and resource pack for PokeWorld recreation. Anyone is free to download and use it however they wish, but a reference back to me would be cool, and don't try to use it to sell anything.

## Installation

[Download the latest `Minecraft_PokeWorld_vX.X.X` zip folder](https://github.com/draav/Minecraft_PokeWorld/releases/latest) then copy it to your saves folder and unzip it. There are more detailed instructions on where to to find your saves folder available [on the wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Map_downloads#Importing_into_Minecraft). You should see a file structure something like:

* `.minecraft`
  * `saves`
    * `Minecraft_Pokeworld_vX.X.X`
      * `advancements`
      * `data`
      * `DIM1`
      * `...`

This project is currently developed for Minecraft version 1.13+. A legacy Minecraft 1.12 version is [available here](https://github.com/draav/Minecraft_PokeWorld/releases/tag/v1.7.0-beta), but it doesn't have any world or texture updates beyond what is listed in that release.

## Warnings

The world looks best (to me) when your light level is set to `moody`, or a little higher.

You will need to be in creative mode right now to fully explore the map. I haven't added all the teleporters in yet. So many areas will be blocked off or not navigatable. 

If you ignore that previous warning and are in adventure mode: If you get stuck outside the barrier blocks surrounding the towns, there isn't really a way back in, so you'll have to fly or tp back. Also let me know how you even did that, so I can fix it.
